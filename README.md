## How do I approach designing software?

  This project helped me learn how to create interactive 3D environments using OpenGL. Doing so required having an in-depth understanding of the OpenGL API and how to use it. This was one of my first times working with an API as complex as OpenGL. Understanding how to work with APIs is an essential skill and will be very helpful in my future work. Using what I learned about this API, I used an object-oriented design approach to separate the objects involved with my 3D scene. These objects would include meshes, textures/materials, the camera, and lighting. This approach helped to structure the development process into iterations. This project was good practice for breaking down the major components of the project into objects due to the widespread usage of object-oriented approaches. 
  
## How do I approach developing programs?

  I followed an iterative and incremental design process to complete this project. I first implemented mesh generation for primitive objects. Next, I added controls for navigating the 3D scene. Then, I implemented the ability to add textures to each object. Finally, I added lighting to make the scene more realistic. I also used modular programming, improving the reusability and maintainability of the code. Developing and testing each component of the project individually helped provide me with a more efficient development process. 

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

  The skills and knowledge I learned in this course will help me in my future as a computer scientist. For my professional career, it was good practice to use these development techniques. Iterative and incremental development and object-oriented programming are very common approaches in professional projects. Becoming familiar with using these techniques is essential for my success as a computer scientist. Additionally, due to the frequent usage of third-party software when creating large projects, being comfortable with learning and applying APIs is another great skill to practice. This course has also been beneficial for my personal projects. In my personal time, I work on game development projects. Learning about OpenGL has helped me to understand how the game engines I use work on a deeper level. Having a better understanding of these engines will be helpful for my future projects in game development.
